# austin-portfolio

My brother's videography portflio site. Please don't judge me on this sloppy code. 

### api

express.js based endpoint that makes multiple calls to vimeo's API and dynamically builds the data needed to render the
site. This allows my brother to manage his site without asking me for changes, purely via Vimeo's API. 

### web
 
static react website. definitely overkill but I am too lazy to learn raw web-components so... yeah. seems to perform well enough.
